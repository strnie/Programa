Project Description

The "RandomSeriesD" project in Java implements a class called RandomSeriesD, with the aim of generating a series of random numbers between 0 and 1000. This class allows the initialization of a series with a specific number of elements and then randomly generates values for each element.

Key Features

Initialization of the Series

The class has a constructor that takes the desired number of elements as a parameter. When an object of this class is created, a series with the desired elements is initialized, all set to 0.

Generation of Random Numbers

The class includes a method called generateRandomSeries(), which uses the Random class to generate random values between 0 and 1000 for each element in the series. Once the series is generated, a message is printed indicating that the series has been generated.

Information about the Series

The class provides a method called getNumberOfItems() that returns the number of elements in the series. Additionally, it prints an informative message when initializing the series with the specified number of elements.

Usage and Version

The code is developed in Java and is intended for educational purposes in programming. The current version is 2b, and it is recommended to review the documentation provided in the source code for additional information.
